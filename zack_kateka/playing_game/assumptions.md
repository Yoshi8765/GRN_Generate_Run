* You will be given rough, biologically reasonable values for each parameter
* There are no outside players; all genes involved are already present
* There can be at most two regulators for each gene
* A single protein cannot act on both regulatory sites of another gene
* The number of regulatory sites a protein can act on is not limited
* INPUT does not act on any genes besides the one it is currently attached to
* A protein might act on nothing
* self-feedback loops are allowed
* The true network is fully connected
* Nothing can act on INPUT
* Your experimental data will have error
* All of the currently provided connections are correct
* INPUT is constant at 1 unit
